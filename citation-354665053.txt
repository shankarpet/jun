Operating systems are an essential part of any computer system. Similarly, 
a course on operating systems is an essential part of any computer science education. 
This field is undergoing rapid change, 
as computers are now prevalent in virtually every arena of day-to-day life 
from embedded devices in automobiles through the most sophisticated planning tools 
for governments and multinational firms. Yet the fundamental concepts remain fairly clear, and it is on these that we base this book.
